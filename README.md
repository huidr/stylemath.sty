## stylemath.sty

[stylemath.sty](https://github.com/ronhuidrom/blob/main/stylemath.sty) is a LaTeX Style (.sty) file tailor-made for quick math typesetting.

### Features

It automatically loads popular packages such as mathtools, amssymb, amsthm, amsfonts, etc. It customizes other packages such as enumitem, hyperref, etc for stylish typesetting.

It also comes with shorthands for commonly used sets, for example, simply typing \R inserts $\mathbb{R}$ and so on. Common phrases in mathematics also have shorthands, for example, \wlog stands for "Without loss of generality" and so on.

|--------- | ----------- |
| \R       | $\mathbb{R}$ |
